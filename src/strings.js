      "My name is Quinn Sweeney, and I'm an 18 year old from the beautiful state of Colorado. Ever since I was old enough to see over my parent's desk, I've been obsessed with computers and how they work. That obsession has driven me down the path of front-end web development, and I couldn't be happier with the way things turned out.",

      "I am a senior (wohoo!) at George Washington High School, and split my time between school and a part time apprenticeship at Pinnacol Assurance. My apprenticehsip experience has been wonderful, and I've had the pleasure to work with the smartest people I've ever met, who all taught me a ton about the web development world, both front-end and back-end.",
