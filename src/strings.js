Ever since I was old enough to see over my parent's desk, I've been obsessed with computers and how they work.

      "I am a senior (wohoo!) at George Washington High School, and split my time between school and a part time apprenticeship at Pinnacol Assurance. My apprenticehsip experience has been wonderful, and I've had the pleasure to work with the smartest people I've ever met, who all taught me a ton about the web development world, both front-end and back-end.",
